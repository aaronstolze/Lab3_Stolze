# Critique

## Bad Code 

```
nibble0 <=
nibble1 <= 
nibble2 <= 
nibble3 <= 
```

This is bad code since none of these variables are assigned to anything.

## Good Code

```
nibble0 <= "0001";
nibble1 <= "0010";
nibble2 <= "0000";
nibble3 <= "0000";
```

This code is now fixed since it has been assigned to something.  

# Functionality

Both the Moore and the Mealy Elevator controls were instantiated which created the bit files to be used in implementation.

Above is a snapshot of the board after the Moore Implementation was implemented.  The elevator would rise on its own without taking input from either the switches or buttons resulting in a constant change of the lights.
